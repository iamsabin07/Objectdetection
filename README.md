# Objectdetection
This project uses python, opencv and pyautogui to detect the object in the image and crop it.

For this particular project, I have taken the screenshot containing a chess board and cropped the chess board out of the screenshot. 
This is the first code of the program that I will be developing. 
The future codes following this one will be dedicated in creating a chess bot to play against the computer.
